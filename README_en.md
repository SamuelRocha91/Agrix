## 📜 Introduction

The Agrix project is an evaluative project developed in the Java module of the Trybe Web Development course. The project involved the use of Java, Maven, Docker, MySQL, and almost the entire Spring ecosystem. The application was built with full implementation freedom, covering everything from code manipulation to configuration.

The application aims to manage and monitor participating farms that seek to improve their technologies and use the land responsibly. The system includes routes for authentication, authorization, farm registration, crop management, fertilizers, and more.

## 🛠️ Implemented Features

- **Authentication and Authorization**: Security implementation using Spring Security to manage access to the application's routes.
- **Entity Registration**: Routes for registering farms, crops, and fertilizers.
- **Inventory and Crop Management**: Features to manage the inventory of fertilizers and crops on the farms.
- **REST API**: Development of a REST API for system interaction.
- **Error Handling**: Implementation of error handling using Spring Web.
- **Docker**: Creation of a Dockerfile to configure the application for Docker execution.

## 📚 Skills Developed

During the development of this project, the following skills were worked on:

- **Spring Framework**: Using Spring to build the application and implement security.
- **Spring Security**: Applying knowledge to add authentication and authorization.
- **Java Web**: Developing a web application using Java.
- **REST API**: Creating API routes and implementation using Spring.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Using it for data persistence in the database.
- **Docker**: Configuring the application to run in Docker containers.
- **JUnit**: Implementing tests with the JUnit framework.

## 📋 Requirements

- **Java 17**
- **Maven 3.8.1 or higher**
- **Docker** (optional, for container execution)
